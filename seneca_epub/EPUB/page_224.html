    <p>LETTERS FROM A STOIC od, II listen to him — can I say fairer than this — from sunrise to sunset.’ When Montanus had just read the lines The sun god starts his fiery flames to extend, The rosy dawn to diffuse her light, and now That plaintive bird, the swallow, starts to thrust Her morsels down the throats of nestlings shrill, With gentle bill supplying each its share, With journeys yet to come, one Varus called out, ‘And Buta starts to sleep.’ Varus was a Roman knight, a friend of Marcus Vinicius, who was always in attendance at good dinners, for which he used to qualify by the sauciness of his tongue. It was he, too, who said a little later on when Montanus had read The herdsmen now in byres have stalled their beasts, And night now starts to bring the drowsy world A dreamy stillness, “What's that you say? Night, is it, now? I'll go and pay a morning call on Buta.’ Buta’s upside-down way of life was a byword, and yet, as I've said, at one time this sort of life was led by a great many people. The reason why some people live in this sort of way is not that they think that night in itself has any special attraction, but that they get no pleasure out of anything which is usual; apart from the fact that daylight is anathema to a bad conscience, a person who experiences a craving or a contempt for things in proportion to their costliness or cheapness looks down his nose at a form of illumination which does not cost him anything. Moreover the man who lives extravagantly wants his manner of living to be on everybody’s lips as long as he is alive. He thinks he is wasting his time if he is not being talked about. So every now and then he does something calculated to set people talking. Plenty of people squander fortunes, plenty of people keep mistresses. 224</p>
