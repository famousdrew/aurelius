    <p>Uax, 17 LETTER LXXXVIII What is to be gained from this sort of knowledge? Am I supposed to feel anxious when Saturn and Mars are in opposition or Mercury sets in the evening in full view of Saturn, instead of coming to learn that bodies like these are equally propitious wherever they are, and incapable of change in any case. They are swept on in a path from which they cannot escape, their motion governed by an uninterrupted sequence of destined events, making their reappearances in cycles that are fixed. They either actuate or signalize all that comes about in the universe. If every event is brought about by them, how is mere familiarity with a process which is unchangeable going to be of any help? If they are pointers to events, what difference does it make to be aware in advance of things you cannot escape? ‘They are going to happen whether you know about them or not. If you observe the hasting sun and watch The stars processing through the skies, the day That follows will not prove you wrong; nor will Deceptive cloudfree nights then take you in.* I've taken sufficient precautions, more than sufficient precau~ tions, to ensure that I’m not taken in by deceptive phenomena. At this you'll protest: ‘Can you really say “the day that follows never proves me wrong”? Surely anything that happens which one didn’t know in advance was going to happen proves one wrong?’ Well, I don’t know what's going to happen; but I do know what's capable of happening - and none of this will give rise to any protest on my part. I'm ready for everything. If I’m let off in any way, I’m pleased. The day in question proves me wrong in a sense if it treats me leniently, but even so not really wrong, for just as I know that anything is capable of happening so also do I know that it’s not bound to happen. So I look for the best and am prepared for the opposite, * Virgil, Georgics, 1:424-6.99 155</p>
