    <p>LU, 6 LETTER LIII were close in there was no waiting on my part for anything to be done in the manner commended by Virgil, Bows faced seawards or Anchor cast from bow.* Remembering my training as a long-standing devotee of cold baths, I dived into the sea in just the way a cold-water addict ought to - in my woolly clothes. You can imagine what I suffered as I crawled out over the rocks, as I searched for a route to safety or fought my way there. It made me realize how right sailors are in being afraid of a lee shore. What I endured, in my inability to endure my then self, is beyond belief. You can take it from me that the reason Ulysses got himself wrecked everywhere was not so much because Neptune was against him from the day he was born, but because he was given to seasickness like me — it'll take me twenty years to reach my destination, too, if I ever have to joumey anywhere by sea! As soon as I'd settled my stomach (for stomachs, as you know, aren’t clear of seasickness the moment they're clear of the sea) and rubbed myself over with embrocation to put some life back into my body, I began to reflect how we are attended by an appalling forgetfulness of our weaknesses, even the physical ones which are continually bringing themselves to our notice, and much more so with those that are not only more serious but correspondingly less apparent. A slight feverishness may deceive a person, but when it has developed to the point where a genuine fever is raging it will extract an admission that something is wrong from even a tough and hardened individual. Suppose our feet ache, with little needling pains in the joints: at this stage we pass it off and say we've sprained an ankle or strained something in * Aeneid, V1:3, 111:277. IOI</p>
