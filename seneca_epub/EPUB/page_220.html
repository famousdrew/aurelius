    <p>LETTERS FROM A STOIC oady, 22 and virile, but if the spirit tumbles all the rest of our personality comes down in ruins with it, The queen unharmed, the bees all live at one; Once she is lost, the hive’s in anarchy.* The spirit is our queen. So long as she is unharmed, the rest remains at its post, obedient and submissive. If she wavers for a moment, in the same moment the rest all falters.t LETTER CXXII Tue daylight has begun to diminish. It has contracted. considerably, but not so much that there is not a generous amount remaining still for anyone who will, so to speak, rise with the daylight itself. More active and commendable still is the person who is waiting for the daylight and intercepts the first rays of the sun; shame on him who lies in bed dozing when the sun is high in the sky, whose waking hours commence in the middle of the day — and even this time, for a lot of people, is the equivalent of the small hours. There are some who invert the functions of day and night and do not separate eyelids leaden with the previous day’s carousal before night sets in. Their way of life, if not their geographical situation, resembles the state of those peoples whom nature, as Virgil says, has planted beneath our feet on the opposite side of the world And when Dawn's panting steeds first breathe on us, For them the reddening Evening starts at length To light their lamps. * Virgil, Georgics, 1V:212-13. + The last 34 lines are omitted (§§23 to 27). + Georgics, 1:250-51. 220</p>
