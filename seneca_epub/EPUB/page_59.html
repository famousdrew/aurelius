    <p>xd, II LETTER XII he did from discreditable motives we should do from honourable ones, saying in all joyfulness and cheerfulness as we retire to our beds, I have lived; I have completed now the course That fortune long ago allotted me.* If God adds the morrow we should accept it joyfully. The man who looks for the morrow without worrying over it knows a peaceful independence and a happiness beyond.all others. Whoever has said ‘I have lived’ receives a windfall every day he gets up in the morning. But I must close this letter now. ‘What!’ you'll be saying. ‘Is it coming to me just as it is, without any parting contribution?’ Don’t worry, it’s bringing you something. Why did I call it ‘something’, though? It’s a great deal. For what could be more splendid than the following saying which I'm entrusting to this letter of mine for delivery to you: ‘To live under constraint is a misfortune, but there is no constraint to live under constraint.’ Of course not, when on every side there are plenty of short and easy roads to freedom there for the taking. Let us thank God that no one can be held a prisoner in life — the very constraints can be trampled under foot. “It was Epicurus who said that,” you protest. ‘What business have you got with someone else’s property?’ Whatever is true is my property. And I shall persist in inflicting Epicurus on you, in order to bring it home to the people who take an oath of allegiance to someone and never afterwards consider what is being said but only who said it, that the things of greatest merit are common property. * Virgil, Aeneid, IV :653. 59</p>
