    <p>DOOTI, 9 LETTER LXX:(III up with him with difficulty when we're out for a run, and before many days are out I won't be able to keep up with him at all. See what daily exercise does for one. When two people are going in opposite directions there’s soon a big distance between them: he’s coming up at the same time as I’m going downwards, and you know how much quicker travel is in the second of these directions. But I’m wrong; the age I'm at isn’t one that is ‘going downwards’ — it’s one that’s in headlong descent. However, you'd like to hear how today’s race ended?

The next thing is breakfast, which consists of some dry bread; no table Jaid, and no need to wash the hands after such a meal. I then have the briefest of naps. You know this habit of mine, of dropping off for a moment or two, just slipping off the harness, as you might say. I find it enough to have simply stopped being awake. Sometimes I know I've been asleep, sometimes merely guess I have been... .* Zeno was a very great man as well as the founder of our Stoic school, a school with an unequalled record for courageous and saintly living; well, listen to the way in which, * A total of about 85 lines of this letter have been omitted as not of interest or repeating thoughts expressed elsewhere. 141</p>
