    <p>cv, 36 LETTER CVIII from Ennius, and in particular those referring to Scipio of Africa: None, foe nor Roman, can assess the value Of his succour and do justice to his feats.* From this passage the scholar claims to deduce that the word ‘succour’ to the early Romans signified the rendering not merely of assistance but of actual services, Ennius saying that no one, foe or Roman, was capable of assessing the value of the services Scipio rendered Rome. Next he congratulates himself on discovering the source from which Virgil chose to take the following: Above whose head the mighty gates of heaven Thunder. He tells us that Ennius filched the idea from Homer and that Virgil filched it from Ennius, there being a couplet of Ennius (preserved in this very work of Cicero’s I was mentioning, The State) which reads If any man may rise to heaven’s levels, To me, alone, lie open heaven’s huge gates. But enough, or before I know where I am I shall be slipping into the scholar’s or commentator’s shoes myself. My advice is really. this: what we hear the philosophers saying and what we find in their writings should be applied in our pursuit of the happy life. We should hunt out the helpful pieces of teaching, and the spirited and noble-minded sayings which are capable of immediate practical application - not far-fetched or archaic expressions or extravagant metaphors and figures of speech ~ and learn them so well that words become works. No one to my mind lets humanity down quite * A fragment of a lost epic. t Georgics, II]: 260-1. 211</p>
