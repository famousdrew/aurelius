    <p>Cvi 12 LETTER CVIII The poor lack much, the greedy everything. The greedy man does no one any good, But harms no person more than his own self.* Your worst miser will clap these lines and be delighted at hearing his own faults lashed in this manner. Imagine how much more likely it is that this will happen when such things are being said by a philosopher, interspersing passages of sound advice with lines of poetry calculated to deepen their hold on unenlightened minds. For ‘the constricting requirements of verse, as Cleanthes used to say, ‘give one’s meaning all the greater force, in the same way as one’s breath produces a far greater noise when it is channelled through a trumpet’s long and narrow tube before its final expulsion through the widening opening at the end.’ The same things stated in prose are listened to with less attention and have much less impact. When a rhythm is introduced, when a fine idea is compressed into a definite metre, the very same thought comes hurtling at one like a missile launched from a fully extended arm. A lot, for example, is said about despising money. The listener is told at very considerable length that men should look on riches as consisting in the spirit and not in inherited estates, and that a man is wealthy if he has attuned himself to his restricted means and has made himself rich on little. But vèrses such as the following he finds a good deal more striking. He needs but little who desires but little. He has his wish, whose wish can be To have what is enough. When we hear these lines and others like them, we feel impelled to admit the truth. The people for whom nothing * Both quotations, and the next two, are believed to be fragments of playsof Publilius Syrus. 203</p>
