NOTES incidentally (which discuss the question whether, in order to enable them to know what is the right thing to do in a given situation, people need a general ‘doctrine’ or a sufficient number of ‘precepts’, or both) are sufficient answer in themselves to critics who have said that Seneca is incapable of setting out a sustained, continuous, consistent argument. One might quote here the opinions of Coleridge: ‘You may get a motto for every sect in religion, but nothing is ever thought out by him’, and Quintilian: ‘As a philosopher he was rather slipshod, though a magnificent censor of moral faults’ (in philosophia parum diligens, egregius tamen vitiorum insectator, Institutio Oratoria, X :1.129).

Erasmus put many quotations from Seneca’s prose works into an anthology known as the Adagia which has been supposed to be the source of most of the imitations or borrowings found in Elizabethan writers.
