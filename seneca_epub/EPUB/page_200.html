    <p>LETTERS FROM A STOIC CVI, II Lead me, Master of the soaring vault Of Heaven, lead me, Father, where you will I stand here prompt and eager to obey. And ev'n suppose I were unwilling, still I should attend you and know suffering, Dishonourably and grumbling, when I might Have done so and been good as well. For Fate The willing leads, the unwilling drags along.* Let us speak and live like that. Let fate find us ready and eager. Here is your noble spirit — the one which has put itself in the hands of fate; on the other side we have the puny degenerate spirit which struggles, and which sees nothing right in the way the universe is ordered, and would rather reform the gods than reform itself. LETTER CVIII Tue subject you ask me about is one of those in which knowledge has no other justification than the knowledge itself. Nevertheless, and just because it is so justified, you're in a great hurry and reluctant to wait for the encyclopedia of ethics I’m compiling at this very moment. Well, I shall let you have your answer immediately, but first I’m going to tell you how this enthusiasm for leaming, with which I can see you're on fire, is to be brought under control if it isn’t going to stand in its own way. What is wanted is neither haphazard dipping nor a greedy onslaught on knowledge in the mass. The whole will be reached through its parts, and *St Augustine quotes this fragment of Cleanthes as Seneca’s (De Civitate Dei, V :8). 200</p>
