    <p>INTRODUCTION SENECA’S LIFE Lucius ANNABUS SBNECA was bom at Cordoba, then the leading town in Roman Spain, at about the same time as Christ.’ His father, Marcus Annaeus Seneca, was an imperial procurator? who became an authority on rhetoric, the art of public speaking and debate.? He was the father not only of our Seneca, who speaks of his ‘old-fashioned strictness’,* but also of Novatus, later known as Gallio, the governor of Achaea who declined to exercise jurisdiction over St Paul (Acts XVII, 11-17), and of Mela, less ambitious than his brothers but an able financier (and father of the brilliant young poet Lucan). Seneca suffered severely from ill health, particularly asthma, throughout his life; he tells us that at one time the only thing which held him back from committing suicide was the thought of his father’s inability to bear the loss.5 He spent a period of his early life in Egypt (where the husband of a devoted aunt named Marcia was the viceroy of the emperor Tiberius from A.D. 16 to 31), there acquiring experience in matters of administration and finance. He also studied the geography and ethnology of Egypt and India® and developeda lasting interest in natural science, speculative rather than empirical (although Pliny speaks of him as an authority on geology, marine life and meteorology, and others have admired his remarks on, for example, evolution or the explanation of rings round the sun). His interest was drawn at an early age to Pythagorean mysticism and various cults of eastern origin then gaining adherents in Rome, before his final acceptance, in large part, of the Stoic philosophy. 7</p>
