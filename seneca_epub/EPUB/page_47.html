    <p>Ix, 2 LETTER IX really ought to be spoken by actors wearing the tragic buskins instead of barefooted pantomime actors! I'll quote one verse of his which belongs to philosophy, and the same facet of philosophy that I was occupied with just now, a verse in which he proclaims that gifts which chance brings our way are not to be regarded as possessions: If you pray a thing may And it does come your way, "Tis a long way from being your own. I recall your expressing the same idea a good deal more happily and succinctly: What fortune has made yours is not your own. And I can’t pass over that even happier expression of yours: The boon that could be given can be withdrawn. (This being from your own stock, I'm not debiting it to your account !) LETTER IX You desire to know whether Epicurus is right in one of his letters in criticizing those who maintain that the wise man is content with himself and therefore needs no friend. This is what Epicurus objects to in Stilbo and those* who believe that the supreme ideal in life is a mind devoid of feeling or as we say impatiens. We are bound to involve ourselves in ambiguity if we try to express in a single word the meaning of the Greek term apatheia by transferring it straight into our word impatientia. For it may be understood in the * Philosophers of the Cynic school. 47</p>
