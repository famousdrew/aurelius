    <p>Lov, 18 LETTER LXXXVI one of us who puts down a new olive plantation is doing so for someone else’s benefit ~ now that I've seen him carefully transplanting one of a number of trees that had given fruit unstintingly over three and even four seasons. So you too can enjoy the shade of the tree which Is slow in coming up, is there to give Your grandsons shade in later years, long hence,* according to our Virgil, who was not concerned with the facts but with poetic effect, his object being the pleasure of the reader, not the instruction of the farmer. To pick out only one example, let me quote the following passage which I felt compelled to find fault with today. In Spring’s the time for sowing beans; then, too, The crumbling furrows, Clover, welcome you, And millet, too, receives her yearly care.f I leave you to conclude from this whether the crops mentioned are to be planted at the same time as each other, and whether in each case they're to be sown in spring. As I write, it’s June, getting on for July now, too, and I’ve seen people harvesting beans and sowing millet on the same day. To get back to our olive plantation, I saw two different methods of planting used here. In the first, taking sizeable trees and lopping off the branches, cutting them back to a foot from the stem, Aegialus transplanted them complete with crown, pruning away the roots and leaving only the actual base, the part to which the roots are attached. This he placed in the hole with an application of manure, and not only earthed it in but trod and stamped the soil down hard. He says that nothing gives such good results as this ‘packing them down’, as he calls it; what it does, of course, is to keep * Virgil, Georgics, TI: 58. t Virgil, Georgics, 1:215-16. 149</p>
