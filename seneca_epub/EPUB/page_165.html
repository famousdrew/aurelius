    <p>XC, 13 LETTER XC of vehicles to support panelled ceilings heavy with gold. Their huts were held up by a forked pole stood at either end, and with close-packed branches and a sloping pile of leaves a run-off was arranged for even heavy rains. This was the kind of roof under which they lived and yet their lives were free of care. For men in a state of freedom had thatch for their shelter, while slavery dwells beneath marble and gold. Another matter on which I disagree with Posidonius is his belief that it was by wise men that tools were originally invented. On that sort of basis there is nothing to stop him saying that is was by philosophers that Discovered next were ways of snaring game, Of catching birds with lime, of setting dogs All round deep woods.* It was human ingenuity, not wisdom, which discovered all that. I disagree with him again where he maintains that it was wise men who discovered iron and copper mining (when the earth had been scorched by a forest fire and had melted to produce a flow from surface veins of ore). The person who discovers that sort of thing is the kind of person who makes it his business to be interested in just that sort of thing. Nor, for that matter, do I find it as nice a question as Posidonius does, whether the hammer started to come into general use before the tongs or the other way round. They were both invented by some individual of an alert, perceptive turn of mind, but not one with the qualities of greatness of of inspiration. And the same applies to anything else the quest of which involves a bent back and an earthward gaze. The wise man then followed a simple way of life — which is hardly surprising when you consider how even in this modern age he seeks to be as little encumbered as he possibly * Virgil, Georgics, 1:139-40. 165</p>
