    <p>Civ, 12 LETTER CIV pitch that if anyone’s ahead of you in the race you'll see yourself as coming last. Death you'll think of as the worst of all bad things, though in fact there’s nothing bad about it at all except the thing which comes before it - the fear ‘of it. You'll be scared stiff by illusory as well as genuine dangers, haunted by imaginary alarms. What good will it do you to Have found a route past all those Argive forts And won escape right through the enemy’s lines?* Peace itself will supply you with new fears. If your ‘mind has once experienced the shocks of fright you'll no longer have any confidence even in things which are perfectly safe; once it has acquired the habit of unthinking panic, it is incapable even of attending to its own self-preservation. For it runs away from dangers instead of taking steps to avert them, and we're far more exposed to them once our backs are tumed. l To lose someone you love is something you'll regard as the hardest of all blows to bear, while all the time this will be as silly as crying because the leaves fall from the beautiful trees that add to the charm of your home. Preserve a sense of proportion in your attitude to everything that pleases you, and make the most of them while they are at their best. At one moment chance will carry off one of them, at another moment another; but the falling of the leaves is not difficult to bear, since they grow again, and it is no more hard to bear the loss of those whom you love and regard as brightening your existence; for even if they do not grow again they are replaced. ‘But their successors will never be quite the same.’ No, and neither will you. Every day, every hour sees a change in you, although the ravages of time are easier to see in others; in your own case they are far less obvious, *Virgil, Aeneid, I: 282-3. 187</p>
