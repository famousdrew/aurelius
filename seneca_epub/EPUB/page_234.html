    <p>13. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. 19. 20. 2I. 22. LETTERS FROM A STOIC that no emperor came near Nero in this five year period can be fully justified’, to paraphrase the words of Aurelius Victor, de Caesaribus, 5, ii (Nero . . . quinquennium tamen tantus fuit, agenda urbe maxima, uti merito Trajanus saepius testaretur procul difere cunctos principes Neronis quinquennio). It should be added that not all historians are agreed that the quinquennium Neronis refers to the frst five years of his rule. Roman History, LXI:3. Annals, XIII:6. Voluptatibus concessis, by which Tacitus may be presumed to refer tothe arts, sensuality and non-political cruelties. Annals, XIII: 2. Roman History, LXI: 4. Grimal, The Civilization of Rome. Seneca’s American translator, Gummere, suggests that this anomalous state of affairs may be seen as an experiment with Plato's ideal of philosopher-kingship, and one which also took account of the conditions of the time, striking a balance between the dangers of one-man rule (of which the recent reign of Caligula was a vivid illustration) and the impossibility of a return to the free elections and near anarchy of the Republic; he describes the result as a kind of cabinet system in which Seneca was the cabinet. Tacitus, Annals, XIII: 42 and Dio, Roman History, LXI: 10 are our sources for the sort of thing that was becoming gossip. Satires, X:16. Tacitus (Annals, XV:64) also used this word praedives, ‘immensely wealthy’, of Seneca, who was almost certainly a millionaire, in terms of sterling, four or five times over. Juvenal incidentally speaks of his generosity with his money as if it was well known even after he was dead (Satires, V:109). Roman History, LX:32. This historian states that Seneca’s sudden recall, backed by force, of enormous sums of money which he had lent to leading natives of the recently conquered province of Britain was a cause of the rising of Buduica or Boudicca (‘Boadicea’) in A.D. 61. Res Rustica, II: 3.3. 23. In Letters CVII and LXXXII, for example. In Letter LXXXVI 234</p>
