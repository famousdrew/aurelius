    <p>INTRODUCTION The translation, originally based on Beltrami’s text (1931), has been brought into line with the Oxford Classical Text (1965) of Mr L. D. Reynolds, to whom I am grateful for help on several points of difficulty. My appreciation is extended also to various friends who may not well recall the help or interest and encouragement at one time or another given by them, and among them to my former tutos Mr T. C. W.

My thanks are due also to Dr Michael Grant for permission to reprint from The Annals of Imperial Rome (Penguin Books, 1956) his translation of Tacitus’ account of Seneca’s death. It may be asked what criteria have been applied in deciding which letters should be included or omitted. The first has been their interest — as they set out a philosophy and contribute to a picture of a man and of his times. The second has been the avoidance of undue repetition of particular themes or topics of a moralist who tends towards repetitiveness. For similar reasons one or two of the letters have been shortened by the omission of a few passages (at places indicated). My ultimate defence must be the anthologist’s plea, or confession, that the choice has been a personal one. POSTSCRIPT TO INTRQDUCTION It is perhaps hard to resist quoting here (in no way seeking to disarm criticism!) from the preface and postscript to the anthology Seneca’s Morals by Way of Abstract published by Sir Roger L’Estrange in 1673: Some other Man, in my Place, would perchance, make you twenty Apologies, for his want of Skill, and Addrefs, in governing this Affair, but thefe are Formal, and Pedantique Fooleries: As if any Man 28</p>
