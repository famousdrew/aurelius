    <p>LETTERS FROM A STOIC DOVII, 12 long would you make it? What’s the point of tears? What's the point of prayers? You're only wasting your breath. So give up hoping that your prayers can bring Some change in the decisions of the gods.* Those decisions are fixed and permanent, part of the mighty and eternal train of destiny. You will go the way that all things go. What is strange about that? This is the law to which you were born; it was the lot of your father, your mother, your ancestors and of all who came before you as it will be of all who come after you. There is no means of altering the irresistible succession of events which carries all things along in its binding grip. Think of the multitudes of people doomed to die that will be following you, that will be keeping you company! I imagine you'd be braver about it if thousands upon thousands were dying with you: the fact is that men as well as other creatures are breathing their last in one way or another in just such numbers at the very instant when you're unable to make your mind up about death. You weren't thinking, surely, that you wouldn’t yourself one day arrive at the destination towards which you've been heading from the beginning? Every journey has its end. Here I imagine you'll be expecting me to tell you the stories of examples set by heroic men? Well, I'll tell you about ones which children have set. History relates the story of the famous Spartan, a mere boy who, when he was taken prisoner, kept shouting in his native Doric, ‘I shall not be a slave!’ He was as good as his word. The first time he was ordered to perform a slave's task, some humiliating household job (his actual orders were to fetch a disgusting chamber pot), he dashed his head against a wall and cracked his skull open. Freedom is as near as that — is anyone really still a slave?5* Would you not rather your own son died like that than lived * Virgil, Aeneid, VI:376. 128</p>
