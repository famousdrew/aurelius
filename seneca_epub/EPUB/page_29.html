    <p>INTRODUCTION that firft takes himfelf for a Coxcomb in his own Heart, would afterwards make himfelf one in Print too. This Ab/tract, such as it is, you are extremely welcome to; and I am forry it is no better, both for your fakes and my own: for if it were written up to the Spirit of the Original, it would be one of the moft valuable Prefents that ever any private Man beJtow'd upon the Publick: Books, and Difhes have this Common Fate; there was never any One, of Either of them, that pleas'd All Palates. And, in Truth, it is a Thing as little to be Wifh'd for, as Expected; For, an Univerfal Applaufe is at leaft Two Thirds of a Scandal. So that though I deliver up thefe Papers to the Prefs, I invite no Man to the Reading of them: And, whofoever Reads, and Repents; it is his Own Fault. To Conclude, as I made this Compofition Principally for my Self, fo it agrees exceedingly Well with My Conftitution; and yet, if any Man has a Mind to take part with me, he has Free Leave, and Welcome. But, let him Carry this Confideration along with him, that He’s a very Unmannerly Gueft, that preffes upon another Bodies Table, and then Quartels with his Dinner.</p>
