    <p>LETTERS FROM A STOIC XV, 7 one makes an impassioned appeal for ‘the help and support of all true men of Rome’ at the very outset. . . .* Our purpose in all this is not to give the voice exercise, but to make it give us exercise. I have relieved you, then, of no little bother. To these favours there shall be added the following small contribution, a striking maxim that comes from Greece. Here it is: “The life of folly is empty of gratitude, full of anxiety : it is focused wholly on the future.’ “Who said that?” you ask. The same man as before. And what sort of life do you think is meant by ‘the life of folly’? Baba’s and Isio’s?t No, he means our own life, precipitated by blind desire into activities that are likely to bring us harm and will certainly never bring us satisfaction if they could ever satisfy us they would have done so by now never thinking how pleasant it is to ask for nothing, how splendid it is to be complete and be independent of fortune. So continually remind yourself, Lucilius, of the many things you have achieved. When you look at all the people out in front of you, think of all the ones behind you. If you want to feel appreciative where the gods and your life are concerned, just think how many people you've outdone. Why be concerned about others, come to that, when you've outdone your own self? Set yourself a limit which you couldn’t even exceed if you wanted to, and say good-bye at last to those deceptive prizes more precious to those who hope for them than to those who have won them. If there were anything substantial in them they would sooner or later bring a sense of fullness; as it is they simply aggravate the thirst of those who swallow them. Away with pomp and show; as for the uncertain lot that the future has in store for me, why should I demand from * The next sentence (dealing further with the correct manner of declamation) is omitted, the text being hopelessly corrupt. t Baba, and one may presume also Isio, was a. celebrated fool or clown. 62</p>
