      "content": "Some things are within your control, and some things are not. Within your control are your thoughts, your impulses, your desires, and your aversions—in short, everything that is truly your own doing. Outside your control are your body, your possessions, your reputation, your job—in short, everything that is not truly your own doing.\n\nThe things within your control are naturally free, unrestricted, and unimpeded. The things outside your control are fragile, dependent, easily blocked, and ultimately belong to others. Remember: if you treat things outside your control as if they were within it, you will meet obstacles everywhere, you will grieve, you will be anxious, and you will blame both fate and other people. But if you recognize that only what is truly yours is yours, no one will ever be able to force you or hold you back. You will blame no one, accuse no one, do nothing against your will. No one will harm you, and you will have no enemies.\n\nSo if you're aiming for these great things—freedom, peace, equanimity—understand that you can't pursue them half-heartedly while also chasing external prizes. You must choose. If you try to have both inner freedom and worldly success, you'll likely fail at both. But if you focus on what's within your control, you can actually achieve happiness.\n\nWhenever something troubles you, practice this: examine it and ask yourself whether it concerns something within your control or outside it. If it's outside your control, remind yourself: \"This is not my concern.\""

When we encounter what we want to avoid, we're miserable.\n\nSo if you only try to avoid things that are within your control—your own harmful choices and bad judgments—you'll never encounter what you're trying to avoid. But if you try to avoid things outside your control—illness, death, poverty—you'll constantly be running into what you fear.\n\nFor now, put aside desire entirely. If you desire things outside your control, you're guaranteed to be disappointed. And you're not yet skilled enough to reliably desire the right things within your control. Instead, focus simply on gently steering away from the things within your control that would harm you. Be moderate and calm in how you go about this."
